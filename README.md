# apple1

Simple Apple 1 emulator. I figured, writing an Apple 1 emulator is a good way to test a 6502 CPU emulator.
It is using ncurses to render Apple 1 terminal.

This is work in progress and at this point it doesn't work.

## TODO:
* Implement 6502 memory reading bug
* Implement 6502 cycle counting
* Implement clocking for Apple 1 (1 MHz)
* Re-implement Apple 1 terminal
